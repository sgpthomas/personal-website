        <p>
	  I'm a grad student (!!) studying with <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bornholt/">James Bornholt</a> at UT Austin. I don't know exactly
	  what I want to work with yet, but I'm interested in applications of PL Theory to synthesis,
	  verification, and design problems.

            I am indebted to <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/">Adrian Samspon</a> and
            <a href="https://rachitnigam.com/">Rachit Nigam</a>. They were my mentors at Cornell and
	    without them I wouldn't be where I am today. Check out the work they do at <a href="https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/">Cornell Capra</a>.
