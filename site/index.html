        <p>
        I'm currently an undergraduate studying Computer Science at Cornell University.
        I like programming languages and thinking about how humans use abstractions to model the world around us.
        It is important to understand these abstractions so that we can use them more effectively and because they can unknowingly shape
        the way that we think about the world.

        Some words to test deployment!

        I am currently working on languages for hardware acceleration in the <a href="https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/">Cornell Capra</a> lab.
